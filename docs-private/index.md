# Welcome to Sensa Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation hub for Sensa's data processing platform. This site contains everything you need to build, deploy, and manage robust data pipelines using our integrated suite of tools.

## What's Inside

### üöÄ Unity Engine
**A modern ETL pipeline orchestration platform**

Unity Engine is our customized data pipeline tool, designed to make building, running, and managing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows intuitive and efficient.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Visual pipeline builder with drag-and-drop interface.
- Robust scheduling and orchestration.
- Built-in data validation and schema management.
- Seamless integration with time-series databases.
- Real-time monitoring and logging.

**Start Here:**

- [Getting Started Guide](engine/getting-started/overview.md) - Learn how to access and navigate Unity Engine
- [Create Your First Pipeline](engine/pipelines/writing-pipelines.md) - Build data pipelines with our visual interface
- [Pipeline Scheduling](engine/pipelines/scheduling-pipe-runs.md) - Automate your workflows

### üêç Unity SDK
**A comprehensive Python library for time-series data processing**

The Unity SDK is our powerful Python library designed specifically for time-series data processing and database operations. Built for internal use, it provides a unified interface for working with time-series databases, data transformation utilities, and pipeline components.

**Key Features:**

- Native time-series database integration.
- PyArrow and Pandas utilities for data manipulation.
- Automatic schema validation and type detection.
- Flexible data format support (DataFrames, dictionaries, InfluxDB Points).
- Type-safe API with comprehensive error handling.

**Start Here:**

- [SDK Overview](sdk/getting-started/overview.md) - Understand the architecture and capabilities
- [Installation Guide](sdk/getting-started/install.md) - Set up the SDK in your environment
- [Quickstart Tutorial](sdk/getting-started/quickstart.md) - Build your first data processing workflow
